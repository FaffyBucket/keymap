keymap known issues:
Function 9 - When a Windows Explorer window is active, and "Autohotkey" is the title of that
             window, the Media_Play_Pause command doesn't work. Seems to be a bug in AHK, not
			 this script.
			 

TO DO:
 - Reorganise file structure.
 - Compress "AHK icons.psd".


keymap version history:
9.3 - Added known issues.
    - Added TO DO.
9.2 - Updated Function 8 to resolve a conflict with Firefox's built-in autocomplete.
    - Removed Windows Vista as a supported platform. It probably works, but is no longer used.
9.1 - Updated Function 1.
9.0 - Added media key shortcuts.
